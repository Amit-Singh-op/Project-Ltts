# Requirements

## Introduction

- This work is taken from Youtube and this has some improvement on it.
- For making this project, we require C Programming, makefile and Unit Testing using Unity.
- ASCII SPACE INVADERS is a game where we move our player(left and right) and shoot enemies to not invade our space.

## Research

Space Invaders is a fixed shooter in which the player moves a laser cannon horizontally across the bottom of the screen and fires at aliens overhead. The aliens begin as four rows of fifteen that move left and right as a group, shifting downward each time they reach a screen edge. The goal is to eliminate all of the aliens by shooting them. The game ends immediately if the invaders reach the bottom of the screen.

I looked up for best ascii invader game which can run into my machine without using graphics and I found it on youtube.
